Millions of transcriptomics samples were generated by the [Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS)](https://lincsproject.org/) program. When these data are processed into searchable signatures along with signatures extracted from [Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)](https://gtexportal.org/home/), and [Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), connections between drugs, genes, pathways, and diseases can be illuminated. SigCom LINCS is a web-based search engine that serves over 1.5 million gene expression signatures processed, analyzed, and visualized from LINCS, GTEx, and GEO. SigCom LINCS is built from the Signature Commons framework, a cloud-agnostic generic platform that can be used to stand up Data Commons with a focus on searchable signatures. SigCom LINCS provides rapid signature similarity search for mimickers and reversers given sets of up and down genes. Additionally, users of SigCom LINCS can perform a metadata search to find and analyze subsets of signatures, and find information about genes and drugs. SigCom LINCS is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) compliant with metadata linked to standard ontologies and vocabularies while all data and signatures within SigCom LINCS are available for download and via a well-documented API. In summary, SigCom LINCS has the potential to accelerate drug and target discovery in systems pharmacology.
